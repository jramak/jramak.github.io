**Welcome to my homepage!**

I am a research scientist in the Central Applied Science team at Meta (formerly, Facebook), where I work on improving products or systems backed by research. Most recently, I worked on approaches to efficiently allocate human review resources, e.g., labels for training ML models, for product teams across the company (see recent papers below for more details).

Before Meta, I was a staff data scientist at Walmart Labs, where I worked on approaches for automated pricing and anomaly detection. I received my Ph.D. in EECS at MIT, advised by Prof. John N. Tsitsiklis, Prof. David Craft, and Prof. Thomas Bortfeld, where I worked on operations research approaches for cancer treatment.
